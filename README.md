# Tourism-Analysis
📌 Project Overview
-------------------------
   This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of tourism data from Uttara Kannada district, Karnataka. Using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib, the project analyzes tourist patterns, crowd levels, seasonal trends, popularity, and environmental sensitivity of various tourist destinations.
   The goal is to gain data-driven insights that can help in tourism planning, sustainable development, and decision-making.

🎯 Objectives
----------------------------------------------------------
1.Analyze tourist footfall across major tourist places
2.Identify popular tourism categories
3.Study seasonal tourist trends
4.Understand crowd levels and eco-sensitivity impact
5.Visualize relationships between entry fee and popularity
6.Present insights using clear graphical visualizations

🛠️ Technologies Used
----------------------------------------------------------
Python
Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis
Matplotlib – Data visualization
Excel Dataset (.xlsx)

📂 Dataset Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The dataset contains tourism-related information of Uttara Kannada district, including:

Column Name	Description
Place	Name of the tourist place
Category	Type of tourism (Beach, Temple, Wildlife, etc.)
Avg_Visitors_Per_Month	Average monthly tourist count
Distance_From_Gokarna_KM	Distance from Gokarna in kilometers
Crowd_Level	Crowd intensity (Low / Medium / High)
Best_Season	Ideal season to visit
Eco_Sensitivity	Environmental sensitivity level
Entry_Fee	Entry fee (₹)
Popularity_Score	Popularity rating
📊 Analysis & Visualizations

The project includes the following analyses:

Average Monthly Visitors by Tourist Place
Tourist Distribution by Category
Tourist Places Ordered by Distance from Gokarna
Crowd Level Distribution
Season-wise Tourist Trends
Tourist Pressure vs Eco Sensitivity
Entry Fee vs Popularity Relationship
Average Popularity by Tourism Category
Each analysis is represented using bar charts, pie charts, line plots, and scatter plots.

▶️ How to Run the Project
---------------------------------------
Step 1: Install Required Libraries
pip install pandas matplotlib openpyxl

Step 2: Place Dataset
Ensure the dataset file
uttara_kannada_tourism_data.csv.xlsx
is in the same directory as the Python file.

Step 3: Run the Python Script
python tourism_analysis.py

📈 Output
-----------------------------------------------------
Multiple visual graphs will be displayed one by one
Each graph provides meaningful insight into tourism trends
Helps in understanding tourism behavior and planning strategies

🌱 Future Enhancements
----------------------------------------------------
Add interactive dashboards using Streamlit or Plotly
Include real-time tourism data
Apply machine learning models for visitor prediction
Perform geo-spatial analysis using maps
Add recommendation system for tourists
